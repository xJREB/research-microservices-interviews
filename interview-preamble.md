This document describes the general guidelines and ethical considerations of this interview study.

## Purpose of this Study

We are researching the migration to Microservices as well as the maintainability assurance of Service- and Microservice-Based Systems, i.e. what processes, metrics, tools, or techniques industry uses to identify and remediate issues that may hinder the maintenance and evolution of systems that are based on service orientation.

This study aims to gather knowledge about industry practices and problems in this area

1. to support the bidirectionally beneficial exchange of knowledge between industry and academia and
2. to point academia towards common industry pain points or suboptimal practices

with the final goal that researchers may better support industry to sustainably develop and evolve long-living service-oriented software.

The goal of this study is _**NOT**_ to evaluate or rate individual employees or companies. Likewise, we have _**NO**_ intention to destroy a company’s competitive advantage by disclosing vital information about technical excellence or weaknesses in their development organization.

## Confidentiality and Anonymity

Everything that is said in the interviews is treated as strictly confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone outside our research team without the participant’s permission, not even to his/her manager. Results are aggregated and anonymized before publication. In no way can individual statements be traced back to a company or an employee. After the interview, participants also have the possibility to exclude or redact statements before the analysis. The complete interview transcripts will _**NOT**_ be published.

## Interview Process and Analysis

Interviewees will be notified about the general topic of the study so that they are familiar with it and can gather information beforehand should they decide to do so. Interview time is estimated between 45 to 60 minutes. We kindly ask your permission to record the interview for transcription. The written transcript will be sent back to the participant for his/her final approval. This is the last chance to remove or redact statements from the interview. After that, the audio will be destroyed and the potentially redacted and approved transcript will be the sole base for our qualitative content analysis.
